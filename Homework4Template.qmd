# Introduction

Description of the problem (e.g. what are you predicting? what variables do you have available? How might this model be useful if you are successful). You should end with a sentence or two about what the impact of these models could be.


# Methods

describe your models in detail (as if explaining them to the CEO of the media company), as well as any pre-processing you had to do to the data.

## Behavioral Clustering Model

### Pros and Cons

What are the pros and cons for each algorithm? What type of data do they work well for? Are there any possible downsides of using them? Provide a justification for why you chose the model you did. Make ggplot scatterplots of pairs of your features to give you a little bit of information about the data, and to help you decide which algorithm to use (you donâ€™t need to make scatterplots for all possible pairs of features, just make sure each feature appears at least once).

### Chosen Model Details

Talk about the model you chose for your behavioral clustering model. Was there any pre-processing? Are there any hyperparmeters (e.g. number of clusters? `eps`? `min_samples`? linkage? distance metric?) you had to choose? How did you choose them?

## Article Clustering Model

Talk about the model you chose for your article clustering model. Was there any pre-processing? Are there any hyperparmeters (e.g. number of clusters?) you had to choose? How did you choose?

# Results

## Behavioral Clustering Model

How did your model perform? What kind of customers are in each cluster? How might this information help the company? What does your PCA plot tell you about your clusters?

# Discussion/Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned from performing these analyses, and at least one suggestion for what you'd add or do differently if you were to perform this analysis again in the future.
